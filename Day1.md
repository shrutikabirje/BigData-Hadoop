c.By running ls labs command you will get the content of labs folder and pwd will give you the path.
 
 
d. Then by entering the path you will get into Lab2.1.

   This folder contains a file named data.txt to view this file run the following command.
   
   Run the following -put command to copy data.txt into the test folder in HDFS:  
   
       hdfs dfs -put data.txt test
   Verify that the file is in HDFS by listing the contents of test:
   
       hdfs dfs -ls test
   
  
### Step5. Copy a File in HDFS

a. Copy the data.txt file in HDFS using the -cp command.

b. Verifing that the file is in both places by using the -ls -R command on test.
 
c. Deleting the data2.txt file using the -rm command.
  
  
### Step6. View the Contents of a File in HDFS

a. Using the ‚Äêtail command to view the end of a file.
